# fakeddit-news-detection

## Problem Statement
The digital age has escalated the spread of fake news, a serious challenge marked by intentional misinformation. 1.Impacts include: Erosion of public trust in news sources Influence on elections and public opinion Incitement of rumours and panic 2.Our project focuses on developing tools using: Natural language processing (NLP) Sophisticated machine learning algorithms 3.Goal: To discern true news from false narratives 4.Outcome: Boost in digital information reliability and media integrity restoration

## Our Proposed Solution
In order to handle the above problem we have decided to build a Neural Network to identify fake news based on what the users have posted. We have built two models one model has
been built from scratch and the other we have loaded in the pre-trained bert model and further trained that to out data.

## Data Description
The Fakeddit dataset is a multimodal resource comprising over one million samples aimed at enhancing fake news detection, integrating both textual and visual data, along with user comments and metadata. With samples labeled via distant supervision for 2-way, 3-way, and 6-way classification, it allows for in-depth, nuanced analysis and has proven pivotal in developing advanced machine learning models that can discern the veracity of news by leveraging the dataset's comprehensive and diverse content.
